# Arduino driver for nRF24L01 2.4GHz Wireless Transceiver

Design Goals: This library is designed to be...

* Maximally compliant with the intended operation of the chip
* Easy for beginners to use
* Consumed with a public interface that's similiar to other Arduino standard libraries
* Built against the Software SPI to fit on iTeadStudio iBoard with non-standard connection
